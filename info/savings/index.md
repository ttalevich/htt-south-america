# Saving with Hi-Tech Tilt

Hi-Tech Tilt is the difference when constructing a solid building. A patented versatile composite system, Hi-Tech Tilt™ provides enormous savings and advantages over conventional tilt-up wall systems. 

Hi-Tech Tilt™ wall system integrates metal studs that are ready for finish-out. Because Hi-Tech Tilt™ uses a minimal 66% less concrete than standard tilt-up wall systems, there is no need for heavy crane. 

Erection times is up to 30% faster. There is also a reduction of finishing labor costs. Hi-Tech Tilt™ does not require spread footing or concrete pour strips. This translates into cost savings for the buyer.
