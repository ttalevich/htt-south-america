Don't take it from us, Hi-Tech Tilt is backed by some of the best constructions companies.

### Design Velocity Enterprises, LLC

> In my experience as and architect for the last 29 years, I have always been on the lookout for new and innovative ideas for construction methods. “Hi-Tech Tilt” has impressed me and many of my associates tremendously. With the market as volatile as it is right now, time and cost is more than just a concern, and more than a requirement for consideration, it is mandatory. 

> With “Hi-Tech Tilt” these requirements have become much easier to achieve. With the ease and simplicity of construction of these walls, time and cost are the benefits. So much so that one of our key clients, “Goodwill Industries of San Antonio” have made it almost a mandatory requirement in construction of there new retail centers. 

> With the time and cost savings there retail center have become almost instant money makers. In closing I highly recommend “Hi-Tech Tilt” for any commercial project and would endorse it without hesitation.

### The Laredo National Bank

> This is to inform you that The Laredo National Bank is satisfied with the full and partial outcome (since two of them are in different construction stages) of the projects we have financed using the Hi-Tech™ Tilt Wall System. Our loan customers, whose projects have or are in the process of being finished with this system, appear to be satisfied with their project’s time and process. 

> Additionally, the product that you have introduced to our market area appears to be cost effective and customers welcome the apparent savings when compared to the conventional tilt wall. The inside wall insulation factor also appears to play an attractive role in their decision making.
